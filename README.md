║   MULTIMODAL AI FOR DISASTER RESPONSE - RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
<br>

  This implementation demonstrates a complete multimodal AI system for
  disaster response that integrates:
    • Satellite Imagery (CNNs with ResNet-50)
    • Text Reports (Transformers with BERT)
    • Sensor Data (Multi-Layer Perceptrons)
    • Geospatial Information (Coordinate encoding)<br>

    
  The system uses cross-attention fusion to combine information from
    all modalities and provides real-time decision support including:
    - Severity assessment
    - Evacuation recommendations
    - Response prioritization<br>

    
  Key Features:
    ✓ Multi-task learning architecture
    ✓ Attention-based multimodal fusion
    ✓ Real-time inference capabilities
    ✓ Comprehensive decision support
    ✓ Automated report generation
